# Computer Vision RPS

# Milestone 1
Created a model using teachable machine and added it to the root folder.

# Milestone 2
Set up a conda environment and installed packages: opencv-python, tensorflow and ipykernel.Dealt with the game logic in another function. Checked the model worked by using code given to me by AICore. Used opencv-python for computer vision and made sure my hand signs were being recognised. 

# Milestone 3
Created two functions 1. To handle with user input 2. To generate a random response as the CPU response. I randomised the CPU response from a list of options and made sure that the user input function allowed me to input a string. 

# Milestone 4
The game decided a winner based on the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors using if-elif-else statements. Used a while loop to create a best of three rounds game and keep track of the wins of each player. I also wrapped everything related to the game in function.
